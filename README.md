# Careshare

As a final project for our first-semester web development class, we came together as a group to create and organize a simple website that demonstrates our skills and also something we are interested in: **charities**.
## Website Content
- Homepage
   - Similar to an Instagram-style page, charities would be able to post and allow users to see what is going on. This would allow them to showcase what items they might need or events they might be planning.
- About Us
   - An about us page featuring information regarding our project/group
- Contact
   - A contact page allowing the user to submit their information and contact us in order to give us feedback or to let us know something new
- Register
   - A register page allowing both users and charities to login and to register, thus allowing for users to board the site
- Donation
   - A donation page that showcases some of our top charities and buttons to showcase what charity to donate toys, clothes or money to.
## How to Use
